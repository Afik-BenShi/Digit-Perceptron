# A Simple Perceptron

This is a simple perceptron I started on summer vacation.</br>
The project is based only on python's included libreries.</br>
It is based on the first two chapters of </br>
[Neural Netrorks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen, which is awesome and also free to read.<br>
Was also inspired by the 3Blue1Brown video series [Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) by Grant Sanderson.

## What Can it Do
- Load MNIST images and labels
- Create a neural network and train it no MNIST data (or other data)
- Save and load networks to json file
- Load and prepare an image to be detected by the network (in progress)
- Simple console UI (in progress)

## What I Want To Do Next
- Improve the network's training based on the next chapters in the book
- Auto-crop loaded images to match MNIST format
- Create and train a new network from console UI
